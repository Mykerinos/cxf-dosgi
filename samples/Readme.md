# CXF DOSGi Examples

All examples are written using DS. For other DI frameworks use their methods to publish and consume
OSGi services.

The features module provides Apache Karaf features for the examples. So using karaf is the easiest way to get the examples up and running quickly.

The SOAP example also provides a bndrun file for bndtools that allows to directly start/debug the service from Eclipse and export it into a runnable jar.

## Examples

* [soap - Publish and Consume JAXWS SOAP services](soap)
* [rest - Publish and Consume REST services] (rest) 
* [security-filter - Custom HTTP filter] (security filter)
* [ssl - SSL support and client cert based auth] (ssl)
